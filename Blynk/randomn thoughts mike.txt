A few random thoughts etc
Starlink saga continues...
It's currently very hot
I have the ac on at night. Bethan and I both noticed it seems the acs both in the annexe and blue/breen rooms
are working in digital mode and do not seem to regulate temp very well...
Hopefully there will be new ones installed in the blue/green rooms before you arrive!
Strangely you might want to bring a very light fleece..
Might be nice to have a thermometer in the room (and the one by the phone I think has had it)
Dont forget your keys :)
I spray insect killer in the bathroom at night to reduce mosy attack
